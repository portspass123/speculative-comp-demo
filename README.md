Overview

A Theory of Speculative Computation explores how computational systems can mirror organic pattern recognition through predictive resonance — a state in which interacting processes align their phases to anticipate, rather than merely react to, input.

The accompanying demo provides a small-scale simulation of this principle using synthetic waveforms. It demonstrates how coherence between iterations (Inter-Trial Phase Coherence, ITPC) increases when processes resonate rather than operate independently.

Core Hypothesis

Resonant computation can emerge when:

Each unit (biological or synthetic) carries a predictive function rather than a reactive one.

Shared frequencies or phase relationships amplify coherence across iterations.

Energy, information, and structure converge — producing an anticipatory, self-correcting dynamic.
